ðŸ“„ README â€” Task 3: SELECT Queries on patient Table
In this task, I worked with the patient table in my hospitaldb database. The goal was to extract meaningful data using various SELECT queries. I applied common filtering and sorting techniques using SQL clauses such as:

WHERE

AND, OR

LIKE

IS NULL

ORDER BY

LIMIT

This helped me understand how to fetch specific rows and patterns from a table.

âœ… What I learned:
How to filter data based on conditions (WHERE, AND, OR)

How to search using patterns (LIKE)

How to find missing values (IS NULL)

How to control result display (ORDER BY, LIMIT)

This task helped me become more comfortable with writing useful and readable SELECT queries.
